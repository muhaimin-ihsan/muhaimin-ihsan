## Hi there 👋

I'm Muhaimin, an NUS undergraduate majoring in Data Science and Analytics

I attempt to make graphs of any statistic I see, including personal ones. 

Theres just a certain itch in me to find out more about my own Spotify history, or even my spendings.

My main programming tach is Python(pandas, Numpy), SQL, matplotlib and plotly to create graphs, and Juptyer to display them.

My personal projects are of an upward trend, with one new aspect of a language being used for each one.

Fun Facts about me:
- I like looking around train stations
- I dont like coffee or tea
- I never get lost
